Hi, I am Kevin Johnson, a Senior Computer Engineering Major from Texas A&M University. I am interested in making the biggest impact on
the world and I am constantly looking for ways to achieve this.

College has potential to be an extremely transformative growth period in a lot of people’s lives. This certainly rang true for me,
because at Texas A&M University I’ve had several opportunities that developed me as a leader and problem solver. My involvement in
student organizations has given me opportunties to engage in several high-impact students that affect students all across Texas A&M
University. In addition, I also got to learn how much of an impact I can make through software and how fun developing mastery over
such a powerful tool is. I hope to utilize thse leadership, interpersonal, and technical skills at Bloomberg to help makle the world a
better place.
