title = 'Amazon Summer Internship 2024'
+++
The period of time when I learned the most about Software Engineering was last summer, when I interned with Amazon. Since I believe in
high-impact ventures, I was extremely happy to play a huge role in ensuring an efficient transportation system for Amazon. With that
being said, there were several factors that made  this internship much more challenging than a typical Amazon internship.

First, I was expected to communicate with the product manager, who I was building the internal tool for, and an internatinal team
based out of India, who had the most up-to-date technical knowledge regarding this internal tool, in order to come up with a perfect
solution that improved Amazon’s business. I also was given an unique opportunity to build something from the ground up, meaning a lot
of advanced infrastructure set up regarding build systems, pipelines, etc. had to be handled by me. My mentor was also based out of
India, so I was also forced to research documentation and talk to others in order to come up with solutions on my own a lot of times.
I was also in the depths of Java and OOP, and this forced me to think a lot about code structure and how it is best done to ensure the
systems we build are the most maintainable and expandable. I saw OOP as not just a silly example in class, but rather as an actual
tool, that when used properly, helps manage complexity by developing abstractions that the next level can afford to not worry about.

However, in the end, I tackled all of these successfully, and some of the solutions I researched and learned about were valuable
enough that I met with my fellow team members to transfer that information to them so that they can use it.

Overall, while challenging, I loved this experience because it developed me as not just a someone who writes code to solves problems,
but also as someone who identifies problems, comes up with the best solution, communicates it with customers and stakeholders, helps
other engineers with any problems they have, and also gets input from other engineers to make sure that I am not doing something in a
harder way when I don’t have to.
